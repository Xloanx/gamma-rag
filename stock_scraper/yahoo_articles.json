Tepid economic manufacturing and construction data released Monday sparked another wall of worry about the US economy. Additionally, investors may be concerned about the company's business in China, which has been tangled up in the trade war drama. Notably, the Wall Street Journal reported that some Chinese buyers are finding ways around export restrictions to get their hands on Nvidia chips. That kind of news could get regulators thinking about tighter measures, which could further limit Nvidia's business in China. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia?  Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . Nvidia’s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago when the stock dropped 14.8% as markets continued to decline. Yields also retreated as worries about a US recession grew. This followed volatility on Friday, August 2, 2024, when the July Non-Farm Payrolls data revealed weaker job growth as the unemployment rate rose. Markets were also concerned that the Fed might be behind in cutting rates, with the Federal Open Market Committee leaving rates steady at 5.25%-5.50% during the July 2024 meeting. For example, respected economist and University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel took an aggressive stance, calling on the Fed to make an emergency 75 basis-point cut in the federal funds rate after the disappointing jobs report. As a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. However, the economy matters as well. Recessions can mean broad-based declines in demand for everything from consumer goods to enterprise software. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market. Nvidia is down 15.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $116.93 per share, it is trading 21.7% below its 52-week high of $149.43 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $17,588. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with DELL. According to Singapore's law minister, K. Shanmugam,  the inquiry tracks the arrest  of three people on charges connected to the alleged fraud involving the misrepresenting of the servers' eventual destination. Whether Malaysia was the planned ultimate destination or whether the servers were subsequently redirected elsewhere is still unknown. The matter has attracted notice since the servers include potentially Nvidia ( NVDA ,  Financials ) processors. To stop powerful artificial intelligence chipsincluding those made by Nvidiafrom being sent to China, the United States has placed export limitations on them. Initiated by an anonymous tip-off, Shanmugam claimed, no foreign authority asked for the probe. To clear things, Singapore has asked U.S. and Malaysian officials for further information. The lawsuit fits under a larger issue about Chinese businesses reportedly buying Nvidia's chips via middlemen, therefore avoiding U.S. export restrictions. Chinese artificial intelligence business DeepSeek is under U.S. investigation for possibly purchasing limited Nvidia processors via companies situated in Singapore. Chinese technological behemoths Alibaba ( BABA ,  Financials ), Tencent ( TCEHY ,  Financials ), and ByteDance (BDNCE) are aggressively buying Nvidia's H20 chip, which is still accessible under present U.S. export rules but may have future limits. Nvidia said it will look into claims of illegal chip diversions to limited purchasers.

{"stock": "NVDA", "title": "Nvidia stock drops as new China chip smuggling report raises investor fears on further export scrutiny", "author": "Laura Bratton", "published_date": "2025-03-03T18:55:30.000Z", "content": "Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock fell nearly 8% Monday to its lowest level since last September as reports surfaced of the tech giant’s AI chips reaching China despite export controls. The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that  Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips are reaching China  through third-party resellers using entities registered in nearby regions in violation of export controls. That report was followed by news that  Singapore is probing Nvidia’s customers Dell  ( DELL )  and Super Micro Computer  ( SMCI ) — companies that make servers using the chipmaker’s Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units) — for potentially violating US export restrictions in shipping servers that may contain Nvidia chips from Singapore to Malaysia. Malaysia is reportedly a throughpoint of chip smuggling to China. Dell stock fell nearly 5%, while Super Micro shares dropped 9%. Super Micro's decline comes after the server maker's shares  suffered a nearly 30% loss  last week. Shares of British chip designer Arm ( ARM ) also sank Monday, dropping almost 5%. Nvidia's decline puts the stock down more than 11% over the past five days, with shares trading at levels below their prior 2025 low of roughly $117 in early February following the introduction of a cheap Chinese AI model that  rocked US markets . \"Anonymous traders cannot acquire, deliver, install, use, and maintain Blackwell products in unauthorized countries,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in a statement. \"We will continue to investigate every report of possible diversion and take appropriate action.\" Nvidia uses Arm’s architecture, a blueprint for a computer chip design, for its Grace CPUs (central processing units, or “traditional” computer chips) used alongside its Blackwell GPUs in its latest AI server system designs manufactured by Dell and Super Micro. \"Investors are increasingly concerned [Nvidia] may be impacted by further restrictions on sales to China,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday. \"So far, NVDA has argued that they are not accountable for their resellers selling into China, but that may not hold up as new restrictions are put in place.\" Nvidia’s  earnings report  last week showed  its newest Blackwell AI server system designs contributed $11 billion to fourth quarter revenue , and the company said Blackwell products have achieved full-scale production despite earlier reports of glitches and overheating issues. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the company’s post-earnings call last Wednesday, “[As] a percentage of total data center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen on the onset of export controls.” The Biden administration  first enacted export controls on the company’s chips in 2022 . “Absent any change in regulations, we believe that China shipments will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remains very competitive,” Kress continued. “We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers.” President Trump is reportedly  considering a further crackdown on Nvidia chip exports to China , expanding restrictions to cover Nvidia’s H20 chips, a version of its Hopper GPUs made for China in compliance with US trade rules. The chipmaker  first began making specialized versions of its GPUs for China in 2022  to comply with Biden’s clampdown on trade with China. Also pressuring Nvidia stock Monday was a report that the chipmaker and rival Broadcom ( AVGO ) are  testing troubled Intel's  ( INTC )  latest chip manufacturing process . Intel's manufacturing division has  historically suffered setbacks , and its latest 18A process was already pushed back at least a quarter. Broadcom dropped 4.5% following the news, while Intel jumped as much as 3.5% before paring gains. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

Chinese buyers are getting their hands on computing systems with Nvidia's Blackwell chips through third-party traders located in other regions,  The Wall Street Journal  reported. Buyers in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam are buying these resources for their own use and reselling a portion to companies in China, the Journal added. Just a week before leaving office, former President Joe Biden introduced  sweeping new chip export restrictions  that further limited several countries, one of which is China, from being able to import chips made for AI in the U.S. At the time, Nvidia said the restrictions would \"derail\" global innovation. Last week,  Microsoft reportedly urged  President Donald Trump to ease these restrictions as big tech companies want to tap China's sprawling AI market. Meanwhile, China  recently urged its AI researchers  to avoid visiting the U.S. When reached, an Nvidia spokesperson provided the following comment: \"AI datacenters are among the most complex systems in the world. Anonymous traders cannot acquire, deliver, install, use, and maintain Blackwell products in unauthorized countries.

The Ark Investment founder says there is a lot of \"pent-up demand\" for Tesla vehicles. The big valuation unlock, in her view, is Tesla releasing robotaxis across the country. \"So I now think they're going to start seeding every state [with robotaxis] and their Full Self-Driving. According to our calculations, their robotaxi will be safer in the fourth quarter than human drivers are,\" Wood told me at the  Bitcoin Investor Week  conference (video above). Wood has consistently said she sees Tesla's stock hitting $2,600 by 2029. Tesla shares are down 27% year to date and are the worst-performing component of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks — which also include Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), Google ( GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Meta ( META ). The stock fell 28% in February alone versus a modest drop for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). The weakness in sentiment reflects more than just concern that Elon Musk's closeness with Trump is turning away buyers around the world. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Read more:  Are electric cars more expensive to insure? Tesla doesn't report monthly sales in China in line with rivals Nio ( NIO ), Li Auto ( LI ), and Xpeng ( XPEV ). But even if it did, they would likely be softer than what all three just reported for February. In the US, prices on used Cybertrucks, Model 3s, Model Ss, Model Ys, and Model Xs continue to drop. Tesla is facing increased EV competition from General Motors ( GM ) and Ford ( F ), while some consumers are opting for hybrids. In the past 90 days, the average price of a Tesla has declined 4.27%,  according to data from CarGurus . The fastest price declines are in Cybertrucks, followed by the Model S. Meanwhile,  new tariffs from the Trump administration  stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. The president has  signed two executive orders  imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, both key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired as well. Listen:  Why you should diversify out of Mag 7 stocks The company's earnings per share missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. \"Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition. Meanwhile, valuation appears to be pricing in upside related to expansion into mass-market segments well beyond our volume forecasts for the Model 3,\" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) dropped 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) fell 0.7%, as the  major US indexes came off a volatile week  and a losing February. Nvidia stock plummeted as much as 7% on Monday  as reports surfaced  that the tech giant’s AI chips are reaching China despite export controls. March trading kicked off with  investors encountering more questions  than answers as  tariff deadlines loom , the Federal Reserve's next meeting fast approaches, and the US economy faces the test of disproving  investors' fears about growth . First quarter economic growth is expected to slide following a string of  weaker-than-expected economic data . Tariffs on  Canada and Mexico are set to come into effect on Tuesday , with no indication that a planned March 4 implementation date will be pushed back again. While 25% duties are planned, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick  hinted that they could be lower  by describing it as a  \"fluid situation.\"  New tariffs on China are also due on March 4, with Beijing said to be  eyeing retaliatory measures  on US agricultural products. Elsewhere, European leaders' weekend effort to rally around Ukraine prompted traders to boost bets on a bump in defense spending in the region, lifting related stocks. The week will bring a crucial jobs report and a batch of retail earnings that could feed or ease concerns about an economic downturn and consumer resilience. The February nonfarm-payrolls report on Friday is  expected to show modest job growth , with the unemployment rate steady at 4%. And in retail earnings ahead, results from Target ( TGT ) on Tuesday and Costco ( COST ) are in focus for what they reveal about American shoppers. Data last week showed consumer  spending unexpectedly fell  in January by the most in four years. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies got a boost after Trump said on Sunday that five digital assets — bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), ether ( ETH-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ), solana ( SOL-USD ), and cardano ( ADA-USD ) —  would be included in a new US strategic cryptocurrency reserve . Prices of those tokens on Monday pared some of the sharp gains booked following the post on social media by the president, with bitcoin trading north of $87,000. Oil tumbled 2% to its lowest level of 2025, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said it will restart some of its curbed production, while a report about sanctions relief for Russia also weighed on energy prices. The decision to begin adding 138,000 barrels a day in April surprised market participants. Many Wall Street analysts expected the cartel would delay the unwinding of production cuts which began in 2023. In recent years the US and other countries gained market share while OPEC reduced production in an effort to keep a floor on prices. On Monday afternoonWest Texas Intermediate crude ( CL=F ) declined more than 2% to $68 per barrel. Brent futures ( BZ=F ) also dropped to trade near $71. Shale producers will likely scale back new well production if oil continues its downward path given higher drilling costs said Ed Hirs, senior fellow at the University of Houston. \"Producers are going to be squeezed,\" Hirs told Yahoo Finance. \"The vast majority will not drill wells at WTI less than $70 per barrel.\" Meanwhile, a Reuters report on Monday afternoon indicated the White House was  planning to possibly give Russia sanctions relief  as it seeks to normalize ties with President Vladimir Putin. Investors anxious for President Trump to return to his first-term playbook of  tweeting about the stock market  may have a long wait ahead of them. While tariff talk has dampened equity prices in recent weeks, a growing number of Wall Street strategists point to Trump's likely first order of business: lowering bond yields — even if it comes at the expense of a falling S&P 500 ( GSPC ). \"It’s reasonable to think that the index has to fall quite a bit more before Trump views it as a concerning signal,\" UBS Financial Services' Jason Draho wrote in a client note on Monday, noting the S&P 500 is sitting at a level below what it was on Inauguration Day but still higher than it was on Election Day. \"There’s also a strong case that the relevant Trump put right now is for Treasuries,\" he wrote, arguing that \"high inflation and rates at the start of Trump 2.0 favor policies that result in disinflationary growth, in contrast to reflation that was welcome during Trump 1.0.\" He added that the best indication of a Treasury put is that Trump himself has tweeted very little about stock market performance, instead posting more often about the debt ceiling and government spending. \"This leads to another conjecture, which is that the Trump Administration may not view slow growth due to higher tariffs and government spending cuts as a policy error, but rather as a necessary step to higher growth later on,\" Draho wrote. Gold rebounded from its worst week of the year as the US dollar ( DX-Y.NYB ) eased and buyers flocked to the safe-haven asset in anticipation of President Donald Trump implementing new tariffs. On Monday, gold futures ( GC=F ) gained more than 1.5% to hover below $2,900. The precious metal rebounded from a loss of roughly 3% last week, when a strong US dollar weighed on the commodity.

Nvidia stock sank after reports surfaced of the tech giant’s AI chips reaching China despite export controls. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell 0.7% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) dropped more than 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) fell 0.6%. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Read  more here.  Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Read  more here.  A string of  weaker-than-expected economic data  has led to sliding projections for first quarter economic growth. On Monday, two separate releases showed activity in the manufacturing sector slowed in February while construction spending fell more than anticipated in January. The Atlanta Fed's  GDPNow tool , which uses already released data in the quarter to project the pace of US economic growth, now projects GDP fell by 2.8% in the first quarter, down from Friday's projection of a 1.5% decline. Economists at Oxford Economics also slashed their GDP estimate following this morning's releases. \"The January figures of private construction have lowered our estimate of Q1 GDP to 0.6% annualized, down from 1% at the end of last week and well below the 2.5% penciled into the February baseline forecast,\" Oxford Economics lead US economist Bernard Yaros wrote in a note on Monday. Tesla stock ( TSLA ) rose 2% on Monday as Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he sees shares of the EV giant rising to $430 as it diversifies into artificial intelligence and robotics. Shares of the EV maker plummeted  almost 28% in February  as the company's EV sales slumped, leaving investors to wonder whether CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics was turning off buyers. Jonas predicted Tesla's full-year 2025 deliveries could decline year over year, \"creating an attractive entry point\" for investors. The analyst reinstated Tesla as a top pick for the auto sector, with a price target of $430 (a roughly 50% increase from Friday's close of $292.98) and a bull case of $800. \"Tesla’s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play’ to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" he added. Read  more here.  Crypto stocks rallied in early trading on Monday after President Donald Trump made new  promises about a US crypto reserve  planned by his administration. In  a post on Truth Social on Sunday , Trump identified five cryptocurrencies that the reserve will draw on — bitcoin, ether ( ETH-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ), solana ( SOL-USD ), and cardano ( ADA-USD ). In January, Trump  issued an executive order to create a national crypto “stockpile”  but did not name the digital assets included. Shares of Strategy ( MSTR ) — the largest corporate holder of bitcoin formerly known as MicroStrategy — rose as much as 12% on Monday morning, but was last trading about 3% higher. Meanwhile, crypto miners Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and MARA Holdings ( MARA ), the latter formerly known as Marathon Digital, both added around 3%. Trading platform provider Coinbase ( COIN ) climbed 1.5%. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: Read  more here.  Data out Monday showed activity in the manufacturing grew less than expected in February while costs increased. The Institute for Supply Management's  manufacturing PMI  registered a reading of 50.3 in February, down from January's 50.9 reading and below the 50.7 economists had expected. Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity, while readings below 50 indicate a contraction. The prices paid index surged to 62.4, up from 54.9 the month prior, reflecting companies' continuing increase in costs. \"Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists’ companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration’s tariff policy,\" Institute for Supply Management Chair Timothy Fiore wrote in the release. \"Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery stoppages and manufacturing inventory impacts. Although tariffs do not go into force until mid-March, spot commodity prices have already risen about 20 percent.\" Another reading on manufacturing activity out Monday also raised concern about President Trump's policies. The final reading of S&P Global's manufacturing PMI hit 52.7 in February, above 51.2 in January and its highest level since June 2022. Despite the upbeat index reading for February, S&P Global Market Intelligence chief business economist Chris Williamson noted that respondents' optimism for the year ahead is waning. “Business optimism about the year ahead has consequently fallen compared to the buoyant mood evident in January, with February seeing an increase in the number of companies citing concerns over tariffs and other policies introduced by the new Trump administration,\" Williamson said in the release. Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors braced for President Trump's targeted tariffs to come into force soon. The market will get key economic insight from Friday's release of the monthly jobs report and from quarterly results from key retailers. The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) climbed 0.5%. while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose about 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) was up 0.3%. Investors expect tariffs on Mexico and Canada will be implemented on Tuesday, along with a doubling of levies on imports from China. Wall Street will be closely watching the February jobs report due Friday. On the earnings front, results from Target ( TGT ), Costco ( COST ), and Kroger ( KR ) will offer more details about the state of the consumer. Markets are  coming off a volatile week  and month in February. And as March trading kicks off, Goldman Sachs strategists warn any rebound in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is likely to prove temporary as the US economy shows signs of  a slowdown. \"In the near term, we believe an improvement in the US economic growth outlook will be required to fully reverse the recent equity market weakness,\" Goldman's David Kostin wrote in a note. \"We expect growth data will again be key for the path of US equities and next Friday's jobs report will represent a major test.\" Goldman revised its 2025 earnings per share growth forecast from 11% to 9% and maintained its 2026 growth forecast of 7%.

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump revealed the names of five digital assets he plans to add to a new strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies, causing surges in the market value of each. Trump shared the announcement on Truth Social, stating that his January executive order on digital assets would establish a stockpile consisting of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. These assets had not been disclosed before. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Inclusion in the reserve sent the world's largest cryptocurrency up by more than 20% from the November lows it was trading at early Friday. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) The second largest cryptocurrency jumped 10% on the news. XRP ( XRP-USD ) XRP (Ripple) spiked to a 38% jump directly after the post, then settled to a 25% gain. Solana ( SOL-USD ) Solana, known as the most \"censorship resistant network\" in the world, was trading 20% higher than pre-announcement.

Fourth-quarter earnings were yet another slam-dunk success -- but instead of celebrating, investors responded by selling the stock. Are Nvidia shareholders tired of winning, or is something deeper at play? Let's explore what the next 12 months could have in store. Nvidia investors usually have nothing to fear on earnings day. The company has a long track record of beating expectations, and the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, which ended Jan. 26, was no exception. Revenue jumped 78% year over year to $39.3 billion, driven by continued strength in the data center segment, where it sells  graphics processing units  (GPUs) for running and training AI algorithms. This technology is rapidly evolving, and Nvidia frequently upgrades its offerings to boost growth and keep competition at bay. The company's latest Blackwell GPUs will be the key to its near-term success. These chips are expensive, with a price tag between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit. However, with significant improvements in speed and energy use compared to previous-generation hardware, they can actually save clients money as they manage AI-related workloads. According to management, Nvidia has reached full-scale production of Blackwell -- selling $11 billion worth in the fourth quarter mainly to large cloud service providers like  Amazon ,  Microsoft , and  Alphabet . Despite the undeniably strong earnings, Nvidia's shares tanked around 8.5% on earnings day, suggesting many shareholders are getting jittery. The apprehension might be related to guidance. While management expects first-quarter revenue to grow to $43 billion (up 65%), they see  gross margins  declining from 78% to 70.6% year over year. Falling margins suggest that competition may be causing Nvidia to lower its prices, which could lead to slower earnings growth. The company faces direct competition from other GPU makers, such as  Advanced Micro Devices , which has designed its MI325X to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs. However, the most significant risk might be from custom chips.  Custom chips are optimized for specific applications, eliminating unnecessary components and potentially making them cheaper and more energy-efficient than Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs. While many of Nvidia's clients already use custom chips in small numbers, this trend could grow. In February, OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT) finalized its design with  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  for a custom chip with the goal of mass-producing it next year and reducing reliance on Nvidia. Even if competition doesn't challenge Nvidia's market share, it could hurt its pricing power and margins by making clients more price-sensitive. Another threat comes from the Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which created a competitive large language model (LLM) using Nvidia's older H800 chips. DeepSeek's achievement could raise questions about whether Nvidia's latest hardware is even necessary. With a market cap of $2.9 trillion, Nvidia has limited potential for stock price growth, even in the best-case scenario. The larger something is, the more force is needed to move it. And while the industry-leading chipmaker will likely enjoy top-line expansion, its margins could face pressure as clients turn to custom chips and reevaluate the amount of money they are pouring into what remains a highly speculative industry.  That said, Nvidia still seems like a decent value. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 28, shares are in line with the  Nasdaq-100 's forward estimate, despite the company's excellent growth rate. This valuation prices in much of Nvidia's potential headwinds, so a big crash looks unlikely, absent deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.

A Total Ban Could Be Imposed The Biden administration prevented NVDA and its peers from shipping their most advanced chips to China, and the Trump administration is mulling over the idea of increasing the number of NVDA chips that cannot be shipped to China without licenses, Bloomberg reported last week. What's more, the administration is also pressuring its allies to put curbs on the export of chip-making equipment to the Asian country. But Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein recently suggested that Washington could decide to \"ban every and all NVDA chip sales into China.\" Such a move could cause analysts to cut their revenue and earnings per share estimates for the company for this year by $4 billion to $5 billion and 18 cents, respectively, according to Klein. Klein Remains Bullish on NVDA Despite Klein's warning about Washington possibly banning all sales of NVDA's chips to China, he remains upbeat on the company's overall outlook. That's because the analyst believes that the shares already reflect a decline in the company's revenue from China. Klein thinks that the stock has a better chance of rising in the second half of the year. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company's stock lost 4.5% as of noon ET, but was down as much as 5.3% earlier in the day. The drop comes as the  S&P 500  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  slipped 0.3% and the  Nasdaq Composite   (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)  lost 0.4%. A report released Sunday by  The Wall Street Journal  revealed that despite strict U.S. export restrictions, Nvidia's latest chips are finding their way into China. Since 2022, the U.S. has sought to keep the best artificial intelligence (AI)-powering chips from entering the Chinese market. Nvidia, the undisputed market leader, is barred from selling the latest versions of its chips to Chinese companies. However, a gray market has emerged, allowing Chinese firms to purchase servers filled with Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips. The chips are sold to legitimate partners in the region and are then being routed into the Chinese companies, unbeknownst to Nvidia. The company said it would \"investigate every report of possible diversion and take appropriate action.\" The Trump administration is currently weighing its options in escalating trade tensions with China. In contrast to Canada and Mexico, China did not make overt concessions after the initial round of  tariffs  were imposed earlier this year. It's entirely possible that the administration intends to raise tariffs already, but news that export controls on critical AI-enabling Nvidia chips are being circumvented could lead the administration to up the ante.

Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are  testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer  on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that  Intel’s tests with Broadcom  on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft ( MSFT ) announced that it was  tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process  for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business  split in two by separate potential deals  with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSM ). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

If these tests turn into actual contracts, it would be a massive win for Intel's struggling foundry business. But it's not a done deal yet. The company has faced repeated delays, and past testing setbackslike Broadcom's previous disappointmentraise doubts about whether Intel can deliver at scale. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE:TSM ) is reportedly in talks to take a stake in Intel's chip factories, hinting at more shakeups in the semiconductor race. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with INTC. Intel has been pushing hard to position its 18A process as a real competitor to Taiwan Semiconductor's cutting-edge tech. But with its foundry business losing $13.4 billion last year, it needs more than just interest from Nvidia and Broadcomit needs committed customers. Even if deals materialize, Intel still faces roadblocks. Many smaller chipmakers won't be able to produce on 18A until at least mid-2026 due to intellectual property issues, and Intel itself has already delayed key timelines. The big question now is whether these tests mark the start of a real turnaroundor just another hype cycle. For investors, the stakes are high. If Intel lands Nvidia and Broadcom as long-term clients, it could breathe new life into its foundry ambitions and shift the power dynamic in the industry. But there's no guarantee. Chipmakers routinely explore multiple suppliers, and manufacturing tests don't always lead to production deals. Analysts remain splitsome see Intel as a turnaround play, while others think its structural challenges run too deep. Either way, the next few months will be critical in deciding whether Intel is on the verge of a comeback or still fighting an uphill battle.

The note dated Sunday was the latest from analyst Adam Jonas, a longtime Tesla bull who has praised the company's push beyond autos as sales face pressure from high U.S. borrowing costs and fierce Chinese competition including from BYD. Industry data showed Tesla sales fell 45% in Europe in January while overall EV sales jumped 37% in the region. Jonas said recent setbacks, including Tesla's first annual deliveries drop in 2024, signaled its shift from an \"automotive pure play to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics.\" He reaffirmed his $430 price target, one of Wall Street's highest, which implies a 44% upside to the stock's last trade. The remarks echoed Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has pivoted the automaker to robotaxis and AI in the past year, even as experts argue that large-scale adoption of the vehicles could be years away due to regulatory hurdles and technological limitations. Jonas is no stranger to bold Tesla predictions. In September 2023, he said Tesla's Dojo supercomputer could boost its market value by nearly $600 billion through advancements in robotaxis. Since then, Tesla's market value has risen by about $150 billion to nearly $950 billion. But its shares have trailed the broader U.S. market this year, declining 27% as early euphoria over Donald Trump's election win waned, giving way to concerns about weakening sales and CEO Elon Musk's White House engagements. While Musk has promised sales growth this year with the launch of cheaper models, Jonas said deliveries could decline in 2025, providing an \"attractive entry point.\" In October, Tesla showcased its robotaxi, while Musk touted progress on its humanoid robot \"Optimus,\" which could eventually be priced at $20,000 to $30,000. Musk has said Tesla will roll out driverless ride-hailing services in California and Texas this year but provided no further details.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. The company expects Tesla to grow into artificial intelligence and robotics, therefore extending its market prospects, beyond its basic automobile industry. Beyond conventional vehicle sales, especially in AI-driven physical applications not yet fully accounted for in financial models, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said Tesla's market potential stretches. He highlighted the company's robotics effortsincluding humanoid robotsas a potential source of large cash and would help position Tesla leading edge technologically. The research report emphasizes how well Tesla can create fresh income sources by using its current knowledge in artificial intelligence, manufacturing, and automation. Jonas sees Tesla's long-term expansion being facilitated by its emphasis on software, energy solutions, and autonomous technologies. Moving Tesla beyond its reputation as a vehicle maker and into a diversified technology corporation, the development into robotics might provide a new path for its total addressable market. Assuming Tesla produces 7 million cars by 2030 and achieves an 18% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margin, Morgan Stanley has a bull case price objective of $800 per share for the business. The company also gives Tesla's fledgling companiesincluding mobility and network servicesgreat importance.

(TSLA): RBC Sticks to $440 Target Despite Stock Dip", "author": "Ghazal Ahmed", "published_date": "2025-03-03T15:39:28.000Z", "content": "We recently compiled a list of the  10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street .   In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other AI stocks. With the world making significant strides in artificial intelligence, some countries are concerned about the key figures leading these efforts. In the latest news, the  Wall Street Journal  reported that Chinese authorities advised the country’s top artificial intelligence entrepreneurs and researchers to avoid traveling to the United States. According to the report, the authorities are concerned that Chinese experts could divulge important and confidential information about the country’s progress. They also fear that they could be detained and used as a “bargaining chip” in US-China negotiations. READ ALSO:  10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines   and  10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now The report further revealed that those who decide to travel are instructed to report their plans before leaving. Moreover, they must also report on details like what they did and whom they met upon returning. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng didn’t attend the AI summit in Paris in February, as per the report, while the founder of a major Chinese AI startup also canceled a planned U.S. trip last year, also due to instructions from Beijing. In a similar effort, Meta has also fired at least 20 employees who leaked “confidential information outside the company”. Moves like these underscore the importance of privacy and confidentiality, especially in terms of progress in the world of artificial intelligence. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also been instructing top Communist Party officials to improve China's overall security, particularly in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  ( see more details here ). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On February 28, Tom Narayan from RBC Capital maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $440.00. Narayan maintained a buy on the stock despite the stock plunge on Tuesday, February 25 th , which pushed the company’s market cap below $1 trillion. The plunge followed a report from  Reuters  stating how the company’s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems has disappointed owners. There are also concerns regarding the potential over-investment in artificial intelligence weighing in on the stock, as well as the frustration over how little time Musk is putting in his companies over the White House. Overall TSLA  ranks 6th  on our list of the AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) and Toyota ( NYSE:TM ) are rolling out new EV models, pulling in buyers who might have chosen Tesla before.

{"stock": "TSLA", "title": "Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Is Trading Up Today", "author": "Max Juang", "published_date": "2025-03-03T16:46:07.000Z", "content": "Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 3.3% in the pre-market session after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas named the stock a \"Top Pick,\" citing the potential in the autonomous vehicle market and robotics. Jonas added that \"Tesla's YTD auto deliveries have been mostly below expectations, but not particularly narrative changing. Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics.\" Separately, CEO Elon Musk stated on social media platform X over the weekend that Tesla's profits could potentially grow by more than 1,000% over the next five years. But he didn't sugarcoat it, saying that kind of growth would take \"outstanding\" execution. And let's be real, Tesla has a history of setting ambitious targets that aren't always easy to meet. Still, Musk's remarks could offer some reassurance to investors, especially with the stock struggling lately. It could also be interpreted as a sign that the company isn't backing down and is still focused on delivering big results. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $298.17, up 1.7% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Tesla?  Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 114 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock dropped 9.3% on the news that data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association showed the company sold 9,945 cars in January 2025, a drop of 45% from last year, continuing a streak of weak sales in the region. Separately, the trade debates are back after President Trump announced that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico will \"go forward\" when the temporary suspension expires. This sparked fresh worries about supply chain issues and rising costs for companies that depend on cross-border trade, leading analysts to rethink the economic impact on affected industries. Tesla depends on a worldwide supply chain, getting parts and materials from many countries. Tariffs could raise costs and squeeze Tesla's profit margins. Higher tariffs might also make Tesla's cars more expensive in North America, which could hurt sales in its biggest market. Tesla is down 21.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $298.17 per share, it is trading 37.9% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $5,999. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

The market reacted vigorously to the M&A discussions, although CEO Elon Musk publicly denied these claims, which nonetheless caused a ripple effect, boosting Nissan’s stock by 10%. Meanwhile, Tesla’s recent partnership with WattEV on electric truck deliveries signals an ongoing commitment to expanding its EV and charging infrastructure. Added to this, the broader market faced a general decline, with the Nasdaq Composite dropping 4% in February due to disappointing manufacturing data and economic concerns, impacting Tesla along with other tech stocks. While the EV maker's stock faced challenges, it was in line with broader market trends where economic uncertainty and policy impacts remained significant. Click to explore a detailed breakdown of our findings on Tesla. The past five years have seen Tesla Inc.'s shares yield an impressive total return of over 600%, a reflection of investor confidence and operational milestones. Despite the recent short-term pressures, Tesla's journey was marked by consistent profitability and ambitious expansion plans. Significant earnings growth, with annual increases averaging 43%, played a crucial role in market perceptions, alongside strong revenue forecasts. Tesla's deliveries and production remained robust, evidenced by nearly 495,000 vehicles produced in Q4 2023, confirming its operational resilience and efficiency. Moreover, landmark partnerships such as General Motors granting access to Tesla’s Superchargers enhanced the company's ecosystem, while potential acquisitions like discussions with Wiferion GmbH hinted at innovative advancements. Despite legal challenges, such as the arbitration ruling with Matthews International Corp, Tesla maintained investor interest, achieving returns well above the US Auto industry and market averages over the past year.

According to  Forbes , Berkshire's stock climbed 4.1%, pushing its market cap to about $1.08 trillion, while Tesla's shares slipped 2.2%, bringing its valuation down to roughly $1.04 trillion. That swap placed Berkshire in the seventh spot on the S&P 500, nudging Tesla down to eighth.

The company posted $14.52 billion in pretax profit—far exceeding Wall Street's $12 billion estimate. It also wrapped up 2024 with a staggering $334 billion in cash reserves, up from $325 billion the previous quarter, according to  Cashreview . With those solid numbers, investors are betting on Berkshire's steady hand. Tesla, on the other hand, had a rougher earnings season. Fourth-quarter EPS landed at $0.73, missing the expected $0.77.

Since its Jan 29.  earnings report , Tesla's stock has tumbled around 15%, and analysts have cut their 2025 earnings estimates from $3.30 per share to $2.90, according to  Investors Business Daily . Despite the dip, Tesla's long-term backers still believe in its self-driving technology, upcoming EV models, and AI-powered robotics. But the recent stock movement makes it clear: even visionary companies need strong earnings to keep investors happy. Tesla is also feeling the heat from competition, especially in Europe. Its sales in the region dropped 45% in January, with only 10,000 vehicles sold—while the overall European EV market grew 37%, according to  MarketWatch . Chinese automakers, offering cheaper and more tech-packed EVs, are making gains in the market. And then there's Tesla's public image. Musk's political ties—including his association with the Trump administration—have stirred controversy, with some consumers even calling for boycotts. While Tesla still dominates the EV space, shifts in consumer sentiment could have lasting effects.

In a release Monday, Robinhood revealed the top 10 stock buys in February 2025 on Robinhood UK. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) topped the list of most-bought stocks, as investors reacted to its surging share price and the firm’s ability to meet Nasdaq’s deadline for its delayed 2024 annual report. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is said to have followed in second place, shrugging off concerns over China’s DeepSeek as it posted a 78% year-on-year rise in sales to $39.3 billion, surpassing market expectations. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), another AI-linked stock, was in sixth. The company saw its price decline later in the month amid broader sector jitters, though investors continued to back the firm. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) gained traction after announcing aggressive AI investment plans, helping push its stock into the top 10 at number eight. Health-tech firm Tempus AI also made the list (tenth), with its shares initially rallying after the launch of its personal health concierge app, Olivia, before pulling back on valuation concerns. Crypto-linked names remained popular, despite a challenging month for the sector. Investors bought into Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) (fourth placed) and bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (seventh), even as hopes for regulatory reform and governmental adoption dimmed. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) (third) struggled in February, with European sales slowing ahead of the Model Y refresh. However, it made it into the list. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (ninth) also hit the top 10 despite facing selling pressure following a weaker-than-expected Google Cloud earnings report. Finally, Robinhood shares themselves were the fifth most purchased stock on Robinhood UK in February. Robinhood UK’s Lead Analyst Dan Lane noted that, despite sector-wide turbulence, “investors are clearly keeping the faith” in AI and crypto, reinforcing their status as dominant market themes.

Most Read from Bloomberg Cuts to Section 8 Housing Assistance Loom Amid HUD Uncertainty Remembering the Landscape Architect Who Embraced the City How Upzoning in Cambridge Broke the YIMBY Mold NYC Office Buildings See Resurgence as Investors Pile Into Bonds Hong Kong Joins Global Stadium Race With New $4 Billion Sports Park The Shenzhen-based company, which got its start as a spinoff from Huawei Technologies Co., announced a new corporate strategy that centers on building a device-centric AI ecosystem at Mobile World Congress. The funds for its investment push will come from the company and its investors, an Honor representative said, without providing further details. Honor’s biggest backers are local government entities and it also has display maker BOE Technology Group Co. and two of China’s mobile carriers among its investors. Newly appointed Chief Executive Officer James Li, flanked by representatives from partners Qualcomm Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, set out the company’s plan at the mobile industry’s biggest gathering in Barcelona on Sunday. Honor didn’t specify what it will spend the money on, apart from saying it’ll collaborate with global supply chain and carrier partners, like Orange and Telefonica, to co-create “a new paradigm for AI devices in the agentic AI era.” Honor joins a rush toward AI across industries, which has been especially pronounced in China following the breakthrough debut of DeepSeek’s reasoning chatbot. The country’s major internet companies, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have accelerated updates to their AI models and started measuring themselves against the startup’s software. Honor aims to play a role in the contest for users by taking the device as its starting point. The company’s approach is also distinctive for its close collaboration with US partners. Honor works with Google Cloud on the development of its AI agent and is integrating Google’s Gemini deeply into its phone software. At MWC, the company also introduced a Windows-powered AI PC in the MagicBook Pro 14, adding to its collaboration with Microsoft Corp. Questions persist about the monetization potential of new AI technologies and chatbots, with several companies betting on the technology to primarily drive upgrades of hardware. Samsung Electronics Co. made a big push in that direction last year, alongside Apple Inc. with the launch of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16. Honor’s effort will have to measure up against those ventures as well as rising domestic competition in China.

In response to a comment on X that Tesla could see profit growth of 258% over the next 5 years, outpacing NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other Mag 7 stocks, Musk said, “It will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.” Tesla posted non-GAAP EPS of $2.42 in 2024. So, based on Musk’s prediction, Tesla could potentially earn $24.20 per share in 2029. Shares of Tesla currently trade with a P/E of 124x the 2024 EPS numbers. All things being equal, this could suggest a price of $3000 per share by the end of the decade (124x$24.20). Earlier today, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas made Tesla his Top Pick in U.S. autos, citing autonomy and Robotaxi as long-term winners for the company, as well as increased contribution from recurring services revenue and the fast-growing energy storage portfolio. He has a base case price target of $480 and a bull case price target of $800, while noting the large Humanoid robot opportunity is not in their base or bull case, “but is becoming serious enough to move the stock.” Tesla's stock is down 28 percent year-to-date due to worries about slow sales and the political and reputational fallout from Musk’s DOGE involvement.

The investment bank, which continues to identify TSLA as a top pick, expects the company's total addressable market (TAM) to rise going forward. Why Morgan Stanley Remains Very Bullish on TSLA The fact that Tesla's auto deliveries are weakening suggests that the company is changing from a focus on EVs to an emphasis on AI and robotics, well-known Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas contended. Tesla's TAM is likely to increase as AI moves to physical products, and the latter increase is to a large extent not reflected in analysts' estimates for the firm, the analyst believes. Also importantly, the market for AI in products outside of autos will probably be much bigger and grow faster than the market for autonomous vehicles, according to Jonas. The analyst is also very bullish on Tesla's opportunity in the field of robotics, writing that, \"We believe the humanoids opportunity could see a greater quantum of capital behind it with Tesla at the epicenter of the theme.\" The analyst kept an $800 price target on the shares. The Recent Price Action of TSLA Stock In the last month, the shares have sunk 22%, while they are down 16.5% in the last three months.

Shares of the EV maker plummeted  almost 28% in February  as the company's EV sales slumped, leaving investors to wonder whether CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics was turning off buyers. Jonas predicts Tesla's full-year 2025 deliveries could decline year over year, \"creating an attractive entry point\" for investors. The analyst reinstated Tesla as a top pick for the auto sector, with a price target of $430, about a 50% increase from Friday's close of $292.98, and a bull case of $800. \"Tesla’s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play’ to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" he added. \"As we continue our analysis of the overlap of AI and robotics, it is increasingly clear to us that the commercial opportunity of non-auto expressions of embodied AI is likely far larger and faster-adopting than that of autonomous cars,\" wrote Jonas. Tesla stock has given up nearly all of its 40% post-election gain since hitting a closing high of $479.86 in mid-December. As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian  recently pointed out , while new competition has eaten into Tesla’s sales, there is also the effect of CEO Elon Musk and his foray into politics. Protests at Tesla showrooms  across the country in February, along with blowback from the firing of government workers by the Musk-led DOGE, have many  hurling criticisms at the Tesla CEO and GOP lawmakers . Recent surveys show that many voters disapprove of Musk's actions, with  a Quinnipiac poll  from late January finding that voters oppose Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration by a 53% to 39% margin. Tesla is expected to report its first quarter results on April 22. Jonas isn't the only Tesla bull who has predicted shares will rise. Last month, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his Outperform rating and $500+ price target despite ongoing concerns about Musk's involvement in President Donald Trump's second administration.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other undervalued wide moat stocks. As per BlackRock, European equity gains have managed to outpace the US to start 2025. Despite this, the asset manager expects the US to reclaim leadership this year as the corporate earnings strength and the AI theme broaden out. The US equities have long exceeded the performance of their global peers. BlackRock expects that this has been made possible because of deeper capital markets and relative deregulation which promote risk-taking. The US can keep its edge, despite the S&P 500 lagging so far this year. As per Savita Subramanian, head of US Equity and Quantitative Strategy for BofA Global Research, the market has been broadening out. Last year and the year before that, the mega-cap tech companies managed to outperform the rest of the S&P. However, in the current year, broader market trends are visible. As per Subramanian, higher productivity and reshoring of manufacturing to the US are the 2 positive forces that are expected to fuel potential market growth beyond the tech sector. As per Reuters, the volatility is expected to increase due to tariff announcements, policy changes from President Donald Trump, and job cuts, resulting in uncertainty. Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, has a year-end forecast for the S&P 500 of 6,500 as his “base case.” READ ALSO:  7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term  and  8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In . BlackRock expects that mega-cap tech and other AI-linked stocks will keep driving the US equity returns, mainly as and when the AI adoption grows. That being said, there are signs of earnings strength broadening beyond technology. The analysts now anticipate tech to post 18% earnings growth this year in comparison to 11% for the broader index. As per the LSEG data, this is a smaller gap versus 2024. Overall, strong economic growth, broadening of earnings growth and a quality tilt underpin the firm’s conviction and overweight in US stocks as compared to other regions. The valuations for the big tech are backed by healthy earnings, and less lofty valuations for several other sectors. As per Kristy Akullian, CFA, Head of iShares Investment Strategy, there are tailwinds potentially favoring US equities over the rest of the world, mainly large-cap companies. The relatively easy financial conditions, healthy consumer balance sheets, and the expectations of deregulation and tax cuts continue to support the positive view. To list the 12 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we used a screener and sifted through several media reports to choose companies having an economic moat and that analysts see upside to. Next, we filtered out the ones that trade at a forward P/E of less than ~20.0x. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 28. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Average Upside Potential: ~29.4% Forward P/E as of February 28: ~19.2x Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 234 As per Morningstar, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has a wide moat, thanks to the intangible assets, network effect, cost advantage, and customer switching costs. The firm anticipates Google Search to see growth at a mid-to-high-single-digit level over the upcoming 5 years as and when the broader digital advertising market matures and growth rates slow down. Notably, YouTube is expected to grow at a low-double-digit rate over the next 5 years as robust advertising business continues to be supported by increased subscription business, says Morningstar. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s core advertising business is significantly involved in the advertising budgets, allowing the company to benefit from a secular increase in digital advertising spending. The cash flows generated by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s advertising business can be reinvested in growth areas including Google Cloud Platform, AI-infused search, and dynamic projects like Waymo. Apart from this, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is well-placed to capture significant opportunity in the ever-evolving public cloud space given its position as a critical cloud vendor for enterprises focused on digitizing their workloads. Qualivian Investment Partners, an investment partnership focused on long-only public equities, released its Q3 2024 investor letter.  Here  is what the fund said: Overall GOOGL  ranks 2nd  on our list of the undervalued wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

{"stock": "GOOG", "title": "How Are 9 Out of the 11 Stock Market Sectors Outperforming the S&P 500 in 2025?", "author": "Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool", "published_date": "2025-03-02T20:08:00.000Z", "content": "There are plenty of ways to categorize stocks. Some investors think of growth stocks versus value or dividend stocks. Or megacap, large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap if you sort by  market capitalization . There's also a more formal organization technique based on stock market sectors. According to the most commonly used classification system, there are 11 stock market sectors. At the time of this writing, nine of those sectors are beating the  S&P 500  (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)  year to date (YTD). You may be wondering how that is possible, given that the S&P 500 is one of the most well-known stock market indexes. The S&P 500 represents the most valuable U.S. companies, but in some ways, it doesn't represent the broader stock market well. Here's why so many sectors are beating the S&P 500 YTD, what it means for your portfolio, and why it's important to understand the composition of exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) or index funds before you buy them. In recent years, the most valuable U.S. companies have been leading the broader market higher, which has made the S&P 500 more concentrated. Nvidia   (NASDAQ: NVDA) ,  Apple   (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and  Microsoft   (NASDAQ: MSFT)  alone make up a combined 19.6% of the S&P 500. Throw in  Amazon   (NASDAQ: AMZN) ,  Alphabet   (NASDAQ: GOOG)   (NASDAQ: GOOGL) ,  Meta Platforms   (NASDAQ: META) ,  Broadcom   (NASDAQ: AVGO) ,  Tesla   (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and  Netflix   (NASDAQ: NFLX) , and that's 32.6% of the S&P 500. All of these companies fall into the technology, consumer discretionary, or communications sectors, which comprise 52% of the S&P 500. Tech alone makes up 30.7%. However, many of these stocks are underperforming the S&P 500 YTD. In fact, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla are negative YTD, which is dragging down the S&P 500. Meanwhile, industry leaders of other sectors are doing well, which is allowing lower-weighted sectors to outperform the S&P 500 so far this year. When prior market leaders begin underperforming a benchmark, it can be a sign that some folks view those stocks as overvalued. So, they may sell out of those names and turn to other pockets of the market for cheaper growth stocks or switch to value and income stocks. Bouncing in and out of a sector or theme based on whether it is in favor isn't a great idea for individual investors. Rather, a better approach is to be aware of how a handful of companies can move the S&P 500 and ensure you know what makes up an ETF or index fund before buying it. For example, Meta Platforms and Alphabet make up a staggering 48.5% of the  Vanguard Communications ETF  (NYSEMKT: VOX)  -- a fund that mirrors the sector's performance. Similarly, Amazon and Tesla comprise over 40% of the  Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF  (NYSEMKT: VCR) . Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Broadcom make up 48.3% of the  Vanguard Information Technology ETF  (NYSEMKT: VGT) . If you buy a sector ETF, it's worth understanding that just a handful of companies could drive gains or losses. Many investors may buy an S&P 500 index fund for broad-based exposure to the stock market. But even the S&P 500 isn't as diversified as it used to be, given how massive big tech stocks are. The top 10 companies by market cap in the S&P 500 comprise 37.6% of the index. And the top 25 companies make up 50% of the index. That means just 5% of companies are responsible for half of the S&P 500's movements. So, if lower-weighted companies are doing well, it may be overshadowed by the moves in larger companies. When buying individual stocks, it's essential to have a clear investment thesis, which can include factors such as what the company does well, how the market values it, how it stacks up against the competition, where you hope it to be in three to five years (or longer), and why it is a good fit for your portfolio based on risk tolerance and investment objectives. When buying an index fund or ETF, you certainly don't have to know the ins and outs of every holding. After all, most investors buy these funds for broad-based exposure to the general market, a sector, or a theme. However, it is essential to know how that fund will respond based on different market movements and if it diversifies your portfolio or accidentally leads to more concentration. For example, if you already have 10% of your portfolio invested in semiconductor stocks -- and are happy with the size of the position -- then buying an S&P 500 index fund doesn't provide enough diversification since 7.8% of the index is invested in Nvidia and Broadcom. It's also worth noting that your portfolio's performance may vary wildly from the S&P 500 if you don't own top components in the index. So, comparing how you stack up against the index has little to do with your stock picks and more to do with whether big tech stocks are in or out of favor. The dominance of a handful of companies adds an element of concentration risk to the S&P 500. If you have a long-term time horizon, investing in the S&P 500 or individual megacap tech stocks can still be a solid idea. However, concentration risk could make the S&P 500 volatile if there's a major sell-off in some of the leading names, which is something to keep in mind -- especially for risk-averse investors who are choosing an S&P 500 index fund under the assumption it won't be volatile just because it holds hundreds of stocks.

{"stock": "GOOG", "title": "Google’s clinical search-and-answer tool can now query images", "author": "Rebecca Pifer", "published_date": "2025-03-03T09:00:00.000Z", "content": "This story was originally published on  Healthcare Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily  Healthcare Dive newsletter .  Google’s artificial intelligence-backed search-and-answer tool for clinicians can now scrub tables, charts and other images for information, with the goal of giving doctors and nurses a broader view of patients’ health than what’s in clinical notes alone. The tool, called Vertex AI Search for healthcare, is also newly backed by Google’s latest AI model, Google announced Monday. The model, called Gemini 2.0, is faster and more accurate than past iterations, according to the company. Tech giants and developers have announced a number of  new AI tools and initiatives  in the past few days,  hoping to get their products  in front of prospective buyers at the massive HIMSS health IT conference in Las Vegas this week. Google has been working to expand Vertex AI Search for healthcare’s capabilities since  launching the product  last March. The tool uses generative AI to let clinicians search for information across patient notes and other clinical data, and can also answer questions, like queries about a patient’s medical history. It’s an offshoot of Vertex AI Search, a platform that helps developers build search engines for their websites and data stores, that was tuned specifically on medical information. With Google’s new update, Vertex AI Search for healthcare is expanding into what’s known as multimodal AI, when algorithms can understand and pull data from a variety of sources beyond text. Multimodal AI could be particularly helpful in healthcare, an industry in which almost  90% of data is in image form , like x-rays or scans, according to research. With the new multimodal functionality Google is calling “Visual Q&A,” Vertex AI Search can receive images like diagrams directly as an input, without having to convert the image into text first. If the information is relevant to an end user’s search, Vertex AI will include it in its findings, according to Google. Vertex AI, which already integrates with two of Google’s large language models — Gemini 1.5 Flash and  MedLM —  will now also be backed by Gemini 2.0, which was  unveiled in December. A spokesperson for Google did not respond to questions about how many healthcare organizations are currently using Vertex AI Search by time of publication. But it has been used by health systems including Community Health Systems and Highmark Health, and EHR vendor Meditech has woven Google’s AI into its health records software for hospitals. AI documentation company Suki also recently announced its own clinical assistant tool  would use Google’s patient summarization and Q&A technology. Google also announced Monday that it was partnering with physician enablement platform Counterpart Health, a subsidiary of health insurer Clover, to integrate Vertex AI Search into Counterpart’s clinical decision support tool. Clover, which sells Medicare Advantage plans  in five states ,  launched Counterpart Assistant last spring  to peddle its technology platform to third-party clients, targeted toward markets where it  doesn’t  operate an MA plan. Amid rising interest in AI tools from healthcare organizations, cloud giants like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are racing to build out their healthcare products and ink partnerships with health systems holding the keys to valuable patient data. Along with clinical search , Google has been focusing on  tuning large language models  specifically on healthcare data, and unveiled a platform in December to  help organizations craft their own semi-autonomous AI agents . Yet some are concerned that healthcare, an industry with unique privacy and security concerns,  may be moving too quickly to adopt AI , given  a lack of federal regulation  and the technology’s  sticky tendency to make mistakes. And errors could be compounded when non-text inputs like images are introduced into the equation. Last July, researchers at the National Institutes of Health found that an AI model solved questions on a medical quiz with high accuracy,  but made mistakes when describing images.

{"stock": "GOOG", "title": "Ann Summers lingerie models blurred by Google", "author": "James Titcomb", "published_date": "2025-03-03T09:00:00.000Z", "content": "Ann Summers has accused Google of erasing it from search results because of the tech giant’s pornography filters. The adult retailer said Google was  “distorting” the market  for lingerie and sex toys by effectively blacklisting the website with its SafeSearch feature. It said rivals such as Amazon and Marks & Spencer were not subject to the same restrictions despite selling similar products. Ann Summers has complained to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is  investigating Google ’s grip on the search engine market. Google introduced SafeSearch in 2009. The feature eliminates adult websites from search results as well as blurring explicit photos in image results. While the feature is optional, many internet providers now turn it on by default. Ann Summers said that its website was hidden from search results when the feature was turned on – even when customers were directly looking for the company’s products. “This is having a distorting effect on the market,” it wrote in a CMA submission. “For users with SafeSearch on, including those who have not explicitly chosen this feature, they cannot find us via Google Search, the biggest search engine.” It said shoppers were “directed to our competitors instead”, showing examples of M&S’s website leading results for “sexy lingerie” when SafeSearch was activated. “Our lingerie product offering is similar to our competitors, but we are penalised where they are not,” Ann Summers said. The company said it was penalised against rivals even when people searched for its own products. Searching for “Ann Summers sex toys” would blur out results from its websites while showing the same product sold at Boots or Amazon. “We are not visible because of our classification; however, Amazon can appear, despite having a range of over 10,000 sex toys,” it said. “ Google holds a dominant position  in web search, serving as a crucial gateway between consumers and businesses. However, Google inconsistently applies its policies.” Last month, Ann Summers reported an 11pc fall in annual sales to £93m, blaming in part the Google restrictions. The company launched a separate website, Knickerbox, last year in part to circumvent the restrictions. It has said that Google’s SafeSearch means it has lost out on more than 3m website visits. The CMA launched an investigation into Google last month over concerns about the dominance of its search engine and whether it is unfairly harvesting information from news websites. The review could result in Google being classed as having “strategic market status”, a designation that means the regulator can impose strict requirements on the company. An  Ann Summers spokesman  said: “For years, Google SafeSearch has imposed restrictions that has reduced the visibility of our website in search engines, which has resulted in a greater volume of customers unable to find our website. “There continues to be an inequity on sexual wellness retailers in comparison to general retailers that also stock these products. We have been vocal about our frustrations around this topic, and we want to continue to work with Google to find a solution to overcome these barriers.” Google was contacted for comment.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ann-summers-lingerie-models-blurred-090000756.html"},

{"stock": "GOOG", "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $200 Right Now", "author": "Adam Levy, The Motley Fool", "published_date": "2025-03-03T10:25:00.000Z", "content": "One trend has dominated the market for over two years now:  artificial intelligence (AI) . Companies have collectively added trillions of dollars to their market caps thanks to the massive spending on AI and the investor excitement around its potential. Despite the massive run the market is currently on, there could be a lot more AI spending yet to come. Research firm IDC expects businesses to spend $307 billion on AI solutions this year, and that number is projected to more than double to $632 billion by 2028. Of course, not every company will be a winner from all that spending on AI. And even if a company has great prospects, its stock must still present attractive value, which is increasingly difficult among the run-up in stocks. But investors with just $200 can still find great opportunities among  AI stocks  in today's market. Here are three no-brainer buys right now. Alphabet   (NASDAQ: GOOG)   (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  is the parent company of Google, and it plans to spend a massive amount on building AI infrastructure in 2025. Management expects to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, primarily for servers. That speaks to the opportunity management sees in AI, and it's already showing strong signs of capitalizing on that opportunity. The company started incorporating AI-generated responses to search queries in 2023. By the end of 2024, those AI Overviews were available in 100 countries and drive higher satisfaction and engagement than traditional search results. Importantly, Google isn't cannibalizing its advertising business. \"We actually see monetization at approximately the same rate,\" SVP of Google Philipp Schindler said on Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. AI is also behind advances in products like Google Lens and the Circle to Search feature on Android devices. Generative AI has the potential to improve Google's advertising business, making it easier for marketers to develop new creatives and test ad campaigns. Google Cloud has been a big beneficiary of the increased AI spending from other businesses. Its revenue grew 30% last year while its operating margin expanded to 14%. It could see significant growth in the years to come as management noted it remains capacity-constrained and its competitors sport higher operating margins. While Alphabet is spending heavily on AI, it's seeing strong returns on its investment. Earnings per share grew 39% last year and analysts expect 12% further growth this year. Still, shares trade for just $170 as of this writing, less than 19 times analysts' 2025 consensus earnings expectation. That's an incredible bargain for investors and well-deserving of your $200. Producing high-end AI chips requires a lot of specialized equipment, and one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the world is  Applied Materials   (NASDAQ: AMAT) . Unlike most other semiconductor equipment manufacturers, Applied has a broad portfolio of equipment that can serve a range of customers. As chip production expands and becomes increasingly complex, the demand for Applied's products will continue to grow. And there are a couple of factors that ensure Applied will win the majority of new contracts with foundries. First, it benefits from a virtuous cycle, whereby foundries spend more money with Applied than any other equipment maker, giving the company more to invest in R&D. It spent $3.2 billion on research and development to create more advanced equipment in 2024 capable of high-end chip production and lowering error rates in that production. That budget absolutely dwarfs its competitors, ensuring it can continue to offer better equipment than anyone else in the market for years to come. Second, foundries can't afford the downtime required to switch equipment providers. On top of that, there's risk that other equipment won't be able to keep up with advances in technology, which is an unnecessary risk for any manager to take. In other words, the switching costs to move away from Applied's equipment are very high. Applied also operates a high-margin service business to ensure its equipment operates as expected. That business is expected to grow quickly as the complexity of chip manufacturing increases and foundries ramp up production of their next-generation chips. With the stock trading for just $158 as of this writing, it looks like a great bargain for anyone looking to get started investing in AI stocks with just $200. That stock price translates into a forward PE of about 17 and an enterprise-value-to-sales multiple of less than 5. Whichever way you look at it, it's a great value for a company with the competitive position of Applied Materials. Advanced Micro Devices   (NASDAQ: AMD)  is often seen as playing second fiddle to  Nvidia   (NASDAQ: NVDA)  when it comes to making all-important GPUs for AI servers. Indeed, AMD disappointed investors when it forecasted a 7% sequential decline in revenue for 2025's Q1, and affirmed its data center business would experience a similar decline. By comparison, Nvidia forecasts a 9% sequential increase in revenue in its comparable quarter. Still, investors may be discounting the value of AMD's GPU business alongside its progress in taking market share in the x86 CPU market for both servers and consumer PCs. While Nvidia has a significant advantage over AMD with its CUDA software and advanced hardware, AMD provides an important resource for hyperscalers as a secondary source of compute power. Management expects the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips will be more than $500 billion in 2028. Even a small share of that market would be huge for AMD, which generated $12.6 billion in revenue from its data center segment last year. Importantly, AMD has a lot of upside to its margins right now. It increased its gross margin from 45% to 53% in 2024. And while it might not have the pricing power of Nvidia, it should benefit from scaling its operations. That should lead to meaningful operating margin expansion over the next few years toward management's long-term target in the mid-30s from 24% last year. At a price of about $100 per share, investors with $200 could pick up two shares of AMD, and it's certainly worth the price. Shares currently trade for just 21 times analysts' estimate for this year's earnings. On top of that analysts expect earnings to grow another 34% in 2026. With the potential growth ahead for the company, it deserves a higher multiple, and it could end up being a great investment for anyone just getting started with AI stocks.

Launched in September 2023, Meta AI is now replacing conventional search capabilities on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger by being included into these platforms. Changing to a separate app would represent a strategic growth with more user interaction and possible income sources. Responding to a user on Threads who proposed the concept, Zuckerberg said in January that the business was interested in a specialized AI app. With OpenAI's ChatGPT, an independent platform, Meta AI would be directly in competition going forward. For its AI solutions, Meta is looking into monetizing strategies including a premium membership akin to ChatGPT Plus from OpenAI. Susan Li, the chief financial officer, has pointed out possible income sources like subscription-based services and premium AI-driven suggestions. With India as its main market, especially via WhatsApp, Meta AI now claims 700 million monthly active users across its integrated platforms. Still, the separate Meta AI website gets fewer than 10 million monthly views. Already, rivals have developed autonomous artificial intelligence apps. While xAI's Grok is now accessible for iOS users, Android users must join a queue; Google has pushed iOS users into downloading its Gemini app instead of accessing it via the regular Google app. Some Meta AI development team members work seven-day weeks to meet company objectives, according to inside sources, the report said.

However, I think that it's possible. The number of companies in a position to pass Apple is relatively few, based solely on Apple's sheer $3.6 trillion valuation. However, I think that three companies are primed to do it. These three are  Nvidia  (NASDAQ: NVDA) ,  Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and  Alphabet  (NASDAQ: GOOG)   (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . This trio should come as no surprise, as they are the second-, third-, and fifth-largest companies by market cap in the world. So, how will this trio surpass Apple in five years? Simple! Growth. Apple hasn't really grown over the past three years. Just take a look at this chart, which shows how dead the company's financials have been. This is a huge problem for Apple, and it needs to figure something out; otherwise, this anemic growth could cause it to give up its market leadership position. However, FY 2025 doesn't look like it will bring investors much relief. An average of 38 Wall Street analysts project Apple's revenue will grow 4.6% this year. That's more of the same performance, and it opens the door for these other three companies to surpass Apple over the next five years. Microsoft and Alphabet consistently posted double-digit growth for multiple consecutive years, and the next two years look no different. Wall Street analysts see the following growth projections: Company FY 2025 FY 2026 Microsoft 13% 14% Alphabet 11% 11% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Note: Microsoft's fiscal year ends June 30. These projections are pretty consistent with the historical performance of both businesses, so we'll give Microsoft a 13% revenue growth rate and Alphabet an 11% revenue growth rate for our calculations. Over the next five years, this is what their revenue would look like if they continued those growth rates (assuming we give Apple a 5% revenue growth rate). Company 2029 Projected Revenue Apple $505 billion Microsoft $645 billion Alphabet $441 billion Data source: YCharts. However, we're not done with these figures yet, as we need to multiply them by their  profit margins  to understand what profits each company will generate in five years. Company 2029 Projected Profits Apple $123 billion Microsoft $228 billion Alphabet $126 billion Data source: YCharts. So, after five years, Microsoft and Alphabet will outperform Apple in terms of profit production. This could be enough of a catalyst to propel both of them to be valued at a higher level than Apple. As for Nvidia, it's extremely difficult to project out five years due to the rapidly shifting landscape of the artificial intelligence (AI) environment. Its  GPUs  (graphics processing units) power the AI arms race, and it's growing incredibly fast right now. But nobody knows what this business will look like five years from now. However, if we shorten the time frame down to two years, Wall Street projects Nvidia will generate $243 billion two years from now. After multiplying that by its profit margin (56%), it's clear that in two years, Nvidia will be producing around $136 billion in profits -- far higher than the figure Apple is projected to reach in five years. Due to Apple's slow growth, I think it's feasible that these three could surpass Apple in size within five years. However, if Apple can launch a new hit product and reaccelerate its growth to double digits, this may not happen. There have been little signs of life over the past few years at Apple, and this could be an issue for years to come.

The lingerie and adult retailer claims its products are being wiped from search results when SafeSearch is onwhile Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Marks & Spencer, selling similar items, remain untouched. Ann Summers has now taken its case to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is already investigating Google's dominance in search. The company says this isn't just about filtersit's about Google controlling visibility and distorting competition. The financial impact is already showing up in the numbers. Ann Summers reported an 11% drop in annual sales to 93 million, and it's pointing the finger at Google. The company says its website has lost over 3 million potential visitors, with searches for its own products directing users to competitors like Boots and Amazon instead. Meanwhile, its newly launched Knickerbox brand is an attempt to work around the restrictions, but the company is clear: Google's inconsistent policy enforcement is costing them serious business. This case could trigger a regulatory storm. If the CMA rules against Google, it could lead to stricter oversight and set a precedent for how dominant tech players handle online visibility. For investors, this isn't just about Ann Summersit's about whether regulators are ready to rein in Google's influence over search and digital advertising.

In the latest news, the  Wall Street Journal  reported that Chinese authorities advised the country’s top artificial intelligence entrepreneurs and researchers to avoid traveling to the United States. According to the report, the authorities are concerned that Chinese experts could divulge important and confidential information about the country’s progress. They also fear that they could be detained and used as a “bargaining chip” in US-China negotiations.

Moreover, they must also report on details like what they did and whom they met upon returning. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng didn’t attend the AI summit in Paris in February, as per the report, while the founder of a major Chinese AI startup also canceled a planned U.S. trip last year, also due to instructions from Beijing. In a similar effort, Meta has also fired at least 20 employees who leaked “confidential information outside the company”. Moves like these underscore the importance of privacy and confidentiality, especially in terms of progress in the world of artificial intelligence.

Comments on search dominance for Google have been mixed, with some supporting the engine and others viewing it as a problem. According to Yale University Professor Fiona Scott Morton, “Google holds a monopoly in general search that is overwhelming and durable.” Consequently, Samsung responded by saying that the CMA’s potential intervention is possibly going to have a significant effect on it and other original equipment manufacturers as well as challenger browsers. The CMA will be using these responses to determine whether Google’s search and advertising search businesses need to come under the scope of the DMCC and whether it must adjust its practices. These include Google requiring to make the data it collects available to other businesses, allowing more control to publishers over how their data is used, including in Google’s artificial intelligence services.

{"stock": "GOOG", "title": "Review: Oura’s Ring 4 Leads the Emerging Smart Ring Market", "author": "Vlad Savov", "published_date": "2025-03-03T15:00:03.000Z", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The first time I saw a smart ring in person was more than a decade ago, when Nokia’s former head of design Marko Ahtisaari showed me a product from his native Finland. It was the first generation of Oura Health Oy’s health-tracking ring and Marko was helping the startup in its early days. For most people, Oura’s products are still the defining example in this budding category, a simpler and more discreet alternative to a track-everything smartwatch. Most Read from Bloomberg Cuts to Section 8 Housing Assistance Loom Amid HUD Uncertainty Remembering the Landscape Architect Who Embraced the City How Upzoning in Cambridge Broke the YIMBY Mold NYC Office Buildings See Resurgence as Investors Pile Into Bonds Hong Kong Joins Global Stadium Race With New $4 Billion Sports Park Now valued at $5.2 billion, Oura is leading a much more competitive field, with industry heavyweights like Samsung Electronics Co. also getting involved. As the necessary components have gotten smaller, rings are becoming ever more capable replacements for smartwatches and other health gadgets. They can track sleep, activity and heart rate without a conspicuously technological appearance — or a display. Oura’s latest generation, the Oura Ring 4, continues to define the category. Why Now? The $349 Ring 4 arrives at a time when tech companies are racing to invest in artificial intelligence and prove that the technology can generate revenue. Oura Chief Executive Officer Tom Hale sees AI as central to its strategy too, and that’ll require more accurate and sophisticated data collection. The Ring 4 brings a new so-called Smart Sensing system that dynamically adjusts its array of sensors for improved accuracy and battery life. It also eliminates the bulky domes that housed those sensors in previous iterations, allowing it to look and feel much closer to conventional jewelry. Oura’s upgrade comes at a moment when smart rings are surging in popularity, with industry tracker IDC projecting annual sales to nearly double to 1.7 million. The Ring 4 also arrives just in time to compete with Samsung’s Galaxy Ring, which debuted last year with some design and performance shortcomings. Although that product was hardly perfect, the Korean tech giant is the world’s biggest electronics brand and, unlike Oura, doesn’t charge a subscription fee to access all of its smart ring’s software features. With more options in this space, Oura is under pressure to defend the 80% market share it held before last year. What Makes This Smart Ring Different Over several weeks of testing that included wearing the Ring 4 during exercise and overnight, I found it to be a more accurate and reliable health tracker than either its predecessor or Samsung’s alternative. While many might find the titanium ring stylish, I would argue that its software is its biggest strength. Where Oura excels is in distilling all the personal data it collects into an accessible, actionable format. The app offers a “daily readiness score,” for instance, that rates your wellness each morning based on a variety of factors. I also appreciate how the interface is less a repository of stats and more of a knowledgeable fitness coach. The app defaults to tracking calories consumed rather than steps as the main activity metric, and it offers running commentary and helpful suggestions. When a user doesn’t meet their goals, the Oura app is philosophical and encouraging about it. Although it’s fairly uncommon for device makers to require a subscription, the $5.99-per-month fee is lower than some standalone health and fitness apps such as MyFitnessPal or Strava. It also helps that the experience is so polished. Syncing the ring to its mobile app is seamless, and Oura produces more sophisticated readings from its measurements, such as tracking cardiovascular health. The titanium hardware is comfortable when fitted correctly, and without the overhead of a built-in display, it also lasts for nearly a week on a single charge. Those are key advantages for smart rings over bulkier options like the Apple Watch. Rings offer longer battery life than smartwatches and it’s easier to forget you’re wearing one. That’s especially true for sleep tracking, which can be uncomfortable with a watch. Unlike the Galaxy Ring, which misses some peaks in heart rate during exercise, the Ring 4 records a faithful picture of workouts. The software uses machine learning to detect sports and, even when it doesn’t immediately identify a workout, it’ll remember a user’s input and suggest the correct sport on subsequent sessions. The Ring 4 does an accurate job telling the difference between time spent in bed and actual sleep, and it turns that information into actionable advice. The inclusion of a rest mode is also helpful in keeping users engaged — the app is forgiving enough to pause tracking when a user lacks their usual motivation or time — and Oura’s holistic approach to helping users understand their body extends further. The app also provides insights for women’s cycle tracking, such as predicting an optimal fertility window. This is significant given the company’s user base is 59% female, according to Oura, with twenty-something women being the fastest-growing segment as of 2023. The Downsides of This Health-Tracking Tool The subscription fee is likely the biggest hurdle for would-be Oura users. Consumers are used to paying once for hardware from the likes of Apple Inc. and Samsung, with any software upgrades considered an added value. Though that appears to gradually be changing. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, for example, bundles a Fitbit Premium subscription with new fitness devices, but only for six months. In Oura’s case, it has the added challenge of convincing people to try an entirely new kind of product. With Samsung’s $399 Galaxy Ring being subscription-free, Oura has a tougher sales pitch. And there’s little for Oura members who stop paying: free functionality is reduced to a handful of basics such as the daily readiness and sleep scores. Insights, advice and the AI-powered Oura Advisor are all behind a paywall. Beside the recurring cost, the Ring 4 is also a step down in accuracy compared to smartwatches. The Apple Watch line, Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra and Google’s Pixel Watch 3 provide more precise heart-rate information and collect additional data like the number of stair flights climbed each day. Many watches include built-in GPS tracking and storage to hold and play music by connecting to wireless earbuds, all things a ring can’t provide. Smartwatches also commonly support contactless payments and can receive notifications. For all the things that a smart ring can do discreetly, it cannot compete with the full feature set of larger wearables. And yet, most devices in this class cost as much as a smartwatch. The Oura Ring 4’s gold edition is $499. The Takeaway From its first wearable tracker the size of a signet ring to the current one, which could be mistaken for a wedding band, Oura has sliced away much of the bulk while raising expectations for accuracy and utility. The company has successfully associated its name with a growing category of health-tracking gadgets, and the Ring 4 extends that lead. Samsung’s Galaxy Ring may have been competitive with the previous-generation Oura Ring 3, but the latest edition makes significant improvements that leave no doubt about its superiority. As of today, the Finnish pioneer has the most refined design and best user experience in its class. It delivers more and better personalized insights than its competitors, and the brand’s narrower focus means every detail of the user experience seems considered. But staying ahead is now a necessity, if Oura’s business model is to endure. With years between device releases, the company will have to rapidly iterate on its AI and software to keep paying users coming back for more.Read next: Huawei’s Google-Free Phones Are Making Real Progress Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Rich People Are Firing a Cash Cannon at the US Economy—But at What Cost?

Most Read from Bloomberg Cuts to Section 8 Housing Assistance Loom Amid HUD Uncertainty Remembering the Landscape Architect Who Embraced the City How Upzoning in Cambridge Broke the YIMBY Mold NYC Office Buildings See Resurgence as Investors Pile Into Bonds Hong Kong Joins Global Stadium Race With New $4 Billion Sports Park But in February, Gibbons was one of 170 employees fired at the National Science Foundation, a federal agency that has long been a linchpin of domestic technology research and investment. Many of these were probationary staffers and part-time experts like Gibbons who had been handpicked over the past two years specifically for their expertise in AI. About a quarter worked inside groups central to deploying NSF funding for AI research, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg.The wave of layoffs pushed by the Trump administration, combined with looming budget cuts, is now threatening the ability of the NSF to sustain AI research at the scale necessary for the US to remain competitive, according to industry watchers and current and former employees at the organization. These moves risk severing the talent pipeline that feeds the industry’s most cutting-edge companies and ceding leadership in artificial intelligence to China at a time when President Donald Trump has made it a priority to bolster US AI supremacy, largely through a deregulatory agenda.“This directly contradicts other Trump administration priorities,” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Almost every employee with an advanced degree at every American AI firm has been a part of NSF-funded research at some point in their career. Cutting those grants is robbing the future to pay the present.” On Monday, the agency said it would reinstate 84 of the workers to comply with a court ruling that determined the mass firing of probationary employees was illegal. The experts are not among those being being brought back, the NSF said. Attorneys for federal workers also say the temporary order could still be struck down. A spokesperson for the NSF previously told Bloomberg News that the agency is “working expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders.” A White House spokesperson declined to comment. One of the affected departments inside NSF, called the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, had been created as part of the 2022 Chips and Science Act and was considered an important avenue to funnel grants focused on machine learning, robots and advanced manufacturing. The group had been grappling with cuts to its funding, which was slashed by 30% in 2024 to $617.9 million. Now, layoffs mean there are fewer people inside the NSF who can ensure those grants are actually awarded.The layoffs hit AI-focused groups that were operating at capacity to begin with, according to current and former staffers. As a result, many review panels have been postponed or cancelled, stalling funding for some AI projects. It’s also left researchers and institutions that were already approved uncertain about who will be shepherding their projects in the months ahead. And the specter of additional cuts now hangs over academics across the country. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, conceived by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to slash federal spending, has given agencies including the NSF until March 13 to propose additional reductions that could reduce its workforce by up to 50%. Meanwhile, some Republicans in Congress are setting their sights on even more drastic cutbacks. America’s innovation engineCreated in 1950, the NSF has long been a quiet powerhouse for American innovation. The technology behind Larry Page’s and Sergey Brin’s PageRank algorithm, which helped sort digital information and served as the basis for Google, emerged from a project funded by the NSF.Years before generative artificial intelligence went mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT, the NSF also helped lay the foundations for the underlying technology behind AI chatbots.“It’s the place that makes most of the hardcore AI research happen,” said Gibbons, the former NSF staffer and a professor at Hamilton College in New York. “When you think about who funded the work that led to transformers, when people thought neural networks were kind of crazy back in the day, that was coming out of this group.” Much of the conversation around AI competitiveness is currently devoted to private US companies, such as OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc., which are building cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems. But the programs that the NSF funds have long been the fertile ground from which America’s tech giants recruit, said Kumar Garg, president at Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit advisory firm that connects wealthy individuals and foundations with science, technology and innovation projects. “They might write that seminal paper when they’re at Google, but NSF played an important part of their story,” he said.The NSF cuts, while severe, represent a continuation of a longer-term decline in US public research investment as a percentage of GDP. “Private R&D has picked up some of that slack but that’s not going to be enough,” said Garg, who served in the Obama administration’s office of science and technology. “China’s going in the other direction.”Days after the NSF cuts, Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun wrote in a post on LinkedIn that “the US seems set on destroying its public research funding system.” Most other tech leaders have remained silent. An uncertain eraFederal scrutiny of the NSF only appears to be growing. A report led by Republican Senator Ted Cruz flagged $2 billion in NSF-funded projects for potential cuts. He zeroed in on funding descriptions that referenced diversity, equity and inclusion, even when the actual grants were earmarked for technical projects like computing infrastructure. One such program was the $29 million DeltaAI project at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign which uses NSF funding to buy advanced computing chips from Nvidia Corp. to run AI workloads for AI research at institutions across the country. Similar chips-focused programs at San Diego State University and the University of Alaska Fairbanks were also flagged. Bill Gropp, director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, said there appeared to be confusion over what the program means by diversity. “When we’re talking about diversity of researchers, we’re talking about people from different fields, states and disciplines,” he said.So far, there’s no indication that the program’s budget is being cut, he said, but “it’s hard to know what happens next.” One notable alumnus of the University of Illinois and a beneficiary of its computing resources is venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. In a January interview, he said his research there resulted in the Mosaic web browser that helped popularize the internet. Now, he's helping support DOGE effort, recruiting candidates and calling himself the group's “unpaid intern” in an interview last month with the Hoover Institution.With government support uncertain, some researchers and organizations are considering alternative funding sources, including through philanthropies. But there are limits. “Philanthropic funding of the sciences is often aimed at a few schools,” said Margaret Martonosi, a professor at Princeton University who previously served as head of the NSF’s directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering. “It doesn’t help an aspiring AI expert in an arbitrary part of our country get the opportunities they need.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Rich People Are Firing a Cash Cannon at the US Economy—But at What Cost?

Nvidia's chips are subject to strict U.S. export controls, and the U.S. is already probing whether DeepSeek acquired them through third parties in Malaysia, Singapore, and the UAE. Singapore has reached out to U.S. and Malaysian authorities to determine if the seized servers contained restricted tech, suggesting more regulatory scrutiny ahead. If Malaysia wasn't the final stop, the question remainswhere did these high-powered AI chips actually end up? The answer could send ripples through the entire AI and semiconductor supply chain. For investors, this isn't just another tech headlineit's a potential shake-up for Nvidia, Dell, and Super Micro. Nvidia has already been battling U.S. restrictions on its high-end chips, and now, scrutiny over its distribution channels could tighten even further. Dell and Super Micro may also get pulled into regulatory crosshairs, depending on how this unfolds. With AI chip demand soaring and export controls tightening, this case is another sign that the AI arms race is far from over. Keep an eye on how regulators respondbecause the stakes just got even higher.

First announced at Google's I/O developer conference early last year, Data Science Agent was initially launched as a  standalone project . However, Google decided to integrate it into Colab with the goal of helping users access the agent directly from a Colab notebook, said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview. Data Science Agent is available for free as of this week in Colab, although Colab limits free users to a relatively low amount of computing. Google offers a range of paid Colab plans with higher limits starting at $9.99. Data Science Agent is primarily aimed at data scientists and AI use cases, but the agent can also help find API anomalies, analyze customer data, and write SQL code. All users need to do is upload their data and ask the agent a question. Data Science Agent uses Google's Gemini 2.0 AI model family on the backend, along with \"reasoning\" tools to help with feature engineering and data cleaning tasks. Korevec told TechCrunch that Google is constantly improving the agent and using techniques including reinforcement learning, as well as integrating user suggestions, to enhance Data Science Agent's performance. Data Science Agent currently only supports CSV, JSON, or .txt files under 1GB in size. It can analyze about 120,000 tokens in a single prompt, which works out to about 480,000 words. Korevec said that Data Science Agent may come to additional dev-focused Google apps and services in the future. \"We're scratching the surface of what people can do here,\" she said. \"Because it's an agent, we can integrate it into a bunch of different tools, and I don't necessarily want to force people who are shy about looking at the code to go to Colab.\" This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/03/google-upgrades-colab-with-an-ai-agent-tool/", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-upgrades-colab-ai-agent-174106855.html"},

The decline pushed the stock to roughly $118.92, leaving it more than 20% below its all-time high reached in early January. Concerns over slowing artificial intelligence spending and the potential impact of tightening chip export policies have weighed on investor sentiment. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. Mizuho analysts warned Friday that Nvidia could face significant new China AI and export license restrictions, potentially reducing revenues by $4 billion to $6 billion in the second half of the year. Their caution comes amid reports that the Trump administration is set to tighten chip export curbs, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect Tuesday. The administration has also raised tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico and doubled the tariff on Chinese goods. Despite these headwinds, some analysts remain bullish due to strong AI demand. Investors will closely watch next week's key economic indicators. This article first appeared on  GuruFocus .", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-shares-tumble-u-china-174241300.html"},
{"stock": "NVDA", "title": "Nvidia Stock Downgraded by Summit Insights Group Amid AI Market Concerns", "author": "Faizan Farooque", "published_date": "2025-03-03T16:44:37.000Z", "content": "Nvidia ( NVDA ,  Financials )  received a downgrade from  Summit Insights Group following its fourth-quarter earnings report, marking the only negative rating from a Wall Street firm despite the company's strong financial performance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. Driven by demand for artificial intelligence gear, the chipmaker revealed in the current quarter a 78% rise in revenue and an 80% increase in profit. But downgrading Nvidia from Buy to Hold, KinNgai Chan, an analyst with a 70% success history, raised worries about the sustainability of its expansion path. Chan cautioned that the market for artificial intelligence is changing as AI inference calls for less processing capability than AI model development. This tendency would lower demand for Nvidia's high-performance processors, which have the main engine of the company's growth. Although data center capital expenditures for artificial intelligence training remain strong, Chan thinks Nvidia's price no longer offers a good risk-reward ratio. Further influencing the cautious attitude are worries about growing competitiveness in the artificial intelligence business. Operating on older and less costly H800 processors, the DeepSeek AI model developed in China for $6 million indicates possible issues to demand for Nvidia's most expensive graphics processing units. Investors reacted to the downgrading with a stock price drop. Nvidia shares were trading at $118.94 as of Monday, 11:03 AM GMT-5; down 4.8%, for the day. The most recent average price estimate of $179.77 points to a 51.1% upside from present levels.
