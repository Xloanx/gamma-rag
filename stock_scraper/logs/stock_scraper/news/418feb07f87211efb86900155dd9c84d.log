{'stock': 'NVDA', 'title': 'Nvidia sinks almost 10% to lowest level since September', 'author': 'Laura Bratton', 'published_date': '2025-03-03T20:51:03.000Z', 'content': 'Nvidia ( NVDA ) stock sank 9.8% Monday to its lowest level since last September as reports surfaced of the tech giant’s AI chips reaching China despite export controls. The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that  Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips are reaching China  through third-party resellers using entities registered in nearby regions in violation of export controls. That report was followed by news that  Singapore is probing Nvidia’s customers Dell  ( DELL )  and Super Micro Computer  ( SMCI ) — companies that make servers using the chipmaker’s Blackwell GPUs (graphics processing units) — for potentially violating US export restrictions in shipping servers that may contain Nvidia chips from Singapore to Malaysia. Malaysia is reportedly a throughpoint of chip smuggling to China. Dell stock fell nearly 8% following the announcement of the probe, while Super Micro shares dropped over 13%. Super Micro\'s decline comes after the server maker\'s shares  suffered a nearly 30% loss  last week. Shares of British chip designer Arm ( ARM ) also sank Monday, dropping more than 8%. Nvidia\'s decline puts the stock down more than 13% over the past five days. Shares on Monday traded at levels just over their 2025 low of roughly $117 in early February after a cheap Chinese AI model from  DeepSeek fueled a rout in US Big Tech stocks . "Anonymous traders cannot acquire, deliver, install, use, and maintain Blackwell products in unauthorized countries," an Nvidia spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in a statement. "We will continue to investigate every report of possible diversion and take appropriate action." Nvidia uses Arm’s architecture, a blueprint for a computer chip design, for its Grace CPUs (central processing units, or “traditional” computer chips) used alongside its Blackwell GPUs in its latest AI server system designs manufactured by Dell and Super Micro. "Investors are increasingly concerned [Nvidia] may be impacted by further restrictions on sales to China," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an email Monday. "So far, NVDA has argued that they are not accountable for their resellers selling into China, but that may not hold up as new restrictions are put in place." Nvidia’s  earnings report  last week showed  its newest Blackwell AI server system designs contributed $11 billion to fourth quarter revenue , and the company said Blackwell products have achieved full-scale production despite earlier reports of glitches and overheating issues. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said on the company’s post-earnings call last Wednesday, “[As] a percentage of total data center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen on the onset of export controls.” The Biden administration  first enacted export controls on the company’s chips in 2022 . “Absent any change in regulations, we believe that China shipments will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remains very competitive,” Kress continued. “We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers.” President Trump is reportedly  considering a further crackdown on Nvidia chip exports to China , expanding restrictions to cover Nvidia’s H20 chips, a version of its Hopper GPUs made for China in compliance with US trade rules. The chipmaker  first began making specialized versions of its GPUs for China in 2022  to comply with Biden’s clampdown on trade with China. Also pressuring Nvidia stock Monday was a report that the chipmaker and rival Broadcom ( AVGO ) are  testing troubled Intel\'s  ( INTC )  latest chip manufacturing process . Intel\'s manufacturing division has  historically suffered setbacks , and its latest 18A process was already pushed back at least a quarter. Broadcom dropped 7% following the news, while Intel jumped as much as 3.5% before reversing direction. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

Shares were down 8.4% shortly after 3 PM ET on Monday and 13% since reporting earnings last Wednesday after the close. Mizuho desk analyst Daniel O’Regan said these are the five concerns he is hearing that are weighing on the stock today: 1) Tougher China restrictions:  Our team led by Vijay Rakesh highlighted concerns about potential for meaningful new China AI and export license restrictions after recent nominations in the Commerce Department. He noted a ban could remove $4-5B or up to $0.18 from FY26 estimates.  2) Singapore Investigations:  Singapore is investigating whether Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Super Micro servers shipped to Malaysia contained Nvidia chips barred from China, highlighting the role of middlemen in funneling high-end semiconductors. 3) The Trendforce story from earlier  "NVIDIA’s CoWoS Orders Reportedly Face Decline Concerns as Hopper Ends, Market Awaits GB300 Boost."  4) Earnings -  Last week\'s Rev and Margin guidance continue to weigh on sentiment 5) Lack of catalysts...  Nothing until GTC in a few weeks. NVIDIA stock is now down 7% year-to-date and is weighing on the chip index and S&P 500.

{'stock': 'NVDA', 'title': 'Nvidia and Super Micro Computer stock plunge as a new probe over China raises concerns about tighter scrutiny', 'author': 'Josh Fellman', 'published_date': '2025-03-03T19:44:00.000Z', 'content': 'Nvidia ( NVDA ), Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ), and Dell ( DELL ) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state  arrested several people  for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of  the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs  on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock was down about 6% in Monday afternoon trading. Super Micro Computer Stock fell 9%, and Dell slipped about 4.5%.

The tech world was already spooked when it got to know AI models could be developed more cheaply and efficiently. However, the landscape is shifting even further now that DeepSeek has revealed some cost and revenue data related to its V3 and R1 models. Its potential for massive profit margins — up to 545% in ideal conditions — highlights just how effective AI models can be. The new information from DeepSeek reveals the profit margins from less computationally intensive "inference" tasks. This is the stage after training that involves trained AI models making predictions or performing tasks, such as through chatbots. READ ALSO:\xa0 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines \xa0 and\xa0 10 AI Stocks Gaining Momentum Right Now In a GitHub post published on Saturday, DeepSeek revealed that if we assume that the cost of renting one H800 chip is $2 per hour, the total daily inference cost for its V3 and R1 models is $87,072. In comparison, the theoretical daily revenue generated by these models is $562,027, leading to a cost-profit ratio of 545%. In a year, this would add up to just over $200 million in revenue. However, DeepSeek has cautioned that its "actual revenue is substantially lower" because the cost of using its V3 model is lower than the R1 model. Moreover, only some services are monetized as web and app access is free and developers pay less during off-peak hours. DeepSeek’s AI models are notably a product of what is known as “distillation”. Distillation, now a buzz word in the tech world, is a technique used to make cheaper and more efficient AI models. This process involves taking a large AI model, called the ‘teacher,’ and allowing it to train a smaller, more efficient ‘student’ model. Eventually, this helps companies transfer knowledge from big AI systems into smaller, faster, and cheaper versions. Companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and even Meta are joining in on the bandwagon to develop such models. Thanks to this model, AI models can be made cheaply and efficiently, allowing businesses to save money while keeping their AI performances high. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points \xa0( see more details here ). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On February 27,  Reuters  reported that the company has applied for a permit typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, according to California regulators. The move marks the first phase of a series of regulatory approvals that Tesla needs to eventually launch its promised robotaxi service. Currently, the automaker holds the approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California. However, it does not have a permit for driverless testing or operations from the state\'s Department of Motor Vehicles. The permit is required to apply for a driverless taxi service in the state. The company has already applied for a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in November, authorizing it to own and control a fleet of vehicles. The permit, according to CPUC, is a pre-requisite to receiving authorization to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service. However, the current application doesn’t allow the company to offer any autonomous vehicle rides to the public "in any capacity." Overall TSLA  ranks 4th  on our list of the AI stocks to watch now. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

{'stock': 'TSLA', 'title': 'Why Tesla Stock Tumbled 28% in February', 'author': 'Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool', 'published_date': '2025-03-03T20:21:00.000Z', 'content': "After soaring following the election,  Tesla  (NASDAQ: TSLA)  stock ran into a wall in February as a number of news items, macro challenges, and CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative all seemed to contribute to a sharp pullback in the stock. When the dust settled for February, the stock had lost 28%, according to data from  S&P Global Market Intelligence . As the chart below shows, the stock fell through most of the month. Tesla stock soared following the election as investors seemed to believe that Musk's close relationship with Donald Trump would benefit his  EV company . However, that thinking seemed to unravel last month as there's little that Trump can do to directly support Tesla, and Musk's persona seems to be turning off some potential customers due to his leadership in federal government layoffs, support for a far-right party in Germany, and other moves. There wasn't a single factor driving Tesla stock lower last month, but investors seemed to believe that the stock was overvalued following a post-election run-up in the price that came with little change in the business's fundamentals. Investors seem to believe that Musk's work with the Trump administration is becoming a distraction to him. Additionally, the stock fell after he put together a $97.4 billion offer with other investors for OpenAI. Tariffs are also likely to weigh on Tesla as they will on the rest of the auto sector, and pressure on China could also impact a valuable market for Tesla. According to European registration data, a proxy for sales, Tesla registrations in Europe dropped by 45% in January on a year-over-year basis, even as overall sales of EVs were up 37%. That's just one month's worth of data, so it could be subject to supply chain fluctuations or similar issues, but if the trend holds, it could be devastating for Tesla. There's other anecdotal evidence that sales are declining in California, and that anti-DOGE protestors have taken to Tesla stores. It's difficult to say what the reputational risk or damage to Tesla stock is from Musk's embrace of politics, but there clearly is some. If the fundamentals of the business were stronger, Tesla stock might be closer to a floor, but the company reported a decline in vehicles sales last year, and the stock is still expensive, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio well above 100, meaning it could still fall a lot further. Investors are hopeful that AI and robotaxis will drive the next leg up for the stock, but maintaining a strong reputation with consumers is key for making that happen. Musk may be destroying those prospects without knowing it. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 223 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 27, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland reiterated their bullish stance on the stock, giving a “Buy” rating. The rating follows optimism regarding the company’s robust earnings print and strategic initiatives. Rolland noted how Blackwell’s sales have reached $11 billion, exceeding expectations, and dismissing concerns regarding a slower transition to new platforms. In addition, the increased demand for inferencing and training models has led Nvidia’s data center segment to outperform estimates by an estimated $2 billion, the analyst noted. Nvidia’s management has also confirmed that Blackwell production is in full swing, with product ramps anticipated in the quarters ahead. The gaming segment is also likely to experience strong growth once supply constraints ease. Rolland also discussed Nvidia’s excellent progress in the automotive division, marking record revenues, as well as how advancements in physical AI with the Cosmos platform are gaining traction. Although operating expenses and gross margin guidance show some concerns, management has assured improvement by the end of the year.
