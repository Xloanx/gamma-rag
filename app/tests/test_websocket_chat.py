# ðŸ”‘ INSTRUCTIONS TO GET JWT TOKEN FROM SWAGGER UI:
# 1. Open your FastAPI Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
# 2. Register a new user using the `/register` endpoint.
# 3. Log in using the `/login` endpoint.
# 4. After a successful login, click on any secured route.
# 5. Look at the **"Authorize"** button (a lock icon) in the top-right corner.
# 6. Click it, copy the **Bearer Token**, and replace JWT_TOKEN below.

# JWT_TOKEN = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Example JWT Token:
JWT_TOKEN = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiI1NzY3N2Q4Yy0wOWM4LTQ3MjItYWIzNy0wMTE2ZDA3N2EzYWYiLCJhdWQiOlsiZmFzdGFwaS11c2VyczphdXRoIl19.6m9mC-escj2eWbdgrwB-_D0rCiHvoeHm1bqSB_0_gvE"
